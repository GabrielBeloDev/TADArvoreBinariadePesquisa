Binary Search Tree in C

This is a simple example of implementing a Binary Search Tree (BST) in the C programming language. A BST is a data structure that allows efficient insertion, removal, and retrieval of elements.

Compilation

Make sure you have a C compiler like GCC installed on your system. To compile the program, run the following command in the terminal:

gcc main.c abp.c -o main

This will compile the main.c file along with the abp.c file and create an executable named main.

Execution

To run the program, simply enter the following command:

./main

This will start the example program, which allows you to create a tree, insert, remove, query, and list elements in the tree.

Features

The program includes the following features:

1. Create an Empty Tree: Initializes an empty binary search tree.
2. Insert an Element into the Binary Search Tree: Allows you to insert an element into the tree.
3. Remove a Specified Element from the Binary Search Tree: Removes an element from the tree if it exists.
4. Query If an Element Is in the Binary Search Tree: Checks if an element is present in the tree.
5. List All Elements in the Binary Search Tree: Presents all elements in the tree in symmetric order.
6. Destroy the Tree: Frees the memory allocated for the tree.
7. Exit the Program: Ends the program's execution.
